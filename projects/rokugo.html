         <h1>rokugo 六五</h1>
         <p>Rokugo is the first part of my NES (or custom console) emulator - the 6502 processor! Written in Rust</p>
         <p>I'm basing this design on the static w65c02 as that's the version I have as a real chip at home</p>
         <p>The display is a debugger which decompiles the machine code into a human readable format</p>
         <p>I have an idea to overclock this and use it as a graphics processor (ppu) considering old NES ppu units really aren't available.</p>
         <p>Making sure my design works emulated will help me in the hardware step (as syncing clock cycles and r/w to shared memory will be much harder there)</p>
         <p>Then I can make my own custom 8 bit console</p>
         <p>One day I'd like to build my own computer out of logic gates so making an emulator is a good start in understanding everything that goes on behind the scenes</p>
